to be able to run the code run:
pip3 install requirements.txt or pip install requirements.txt in your terminal

All important code in model.ipynb, mostly pay attention to the end, last box in the notebook


final_csv has all the data needed


The Model Takes these inputs:

Year : 2028
Participant Count : Number of participants for a specific country for that Olympics: NEEDS TO BE ESTIMATED
Is Host: 0 for any other country except the united states as they are hosting the Olympics
Historical_Total_Medals: Can be calculated, Historical Total Medals from 2024 + Medals Won in 2024
Past Medal Efficiency: Calculated by the previous olympics total medals / total participants, can also be calculated easily


Only thing that needs to be estimated is Number of Participants, figure out how to predict this, maybe through linear regression, all data needed is in final.csv, 
Pay attention to participant count.
